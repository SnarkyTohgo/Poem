        It was in the stars you know,<br/>
        Me becoming one with you.<br/>
        I would wish on them everyday<br/>
        And my wishes have come true.<br/>

        You 're more than just my lover,<br/>
        You 're my very best friend.<br/>
        I know that I will hold your hand<br/>
        Until our time on Earth ends.<br/>

        Honey, did I tell you yet today<br/>
        How much you mean to me ?<br/>
        For you my perfect match,<br/>
        I would swim the deepest sea.<br/>

        I would climb the highest mountain<br/>
        If you were stuck on top.<br/>
        Kiss me once again my dear,<br/>
        And please never ever stop.<br/>
